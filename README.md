<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Testo Burger (on going MERN Stack Project)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Important Notice!

This website design is inspired from one of many beautiful designs created by [Jthemes](https://themeforest.net/user/jthemes) (A theme forest member). [Jthemes](https://themeforest.net/user/jthemes) is the author of these amazing wordpress themes [Testo - Restaurant Caffe Wordpress Theme](https://preview.themeforest.net/item/testo-restaurant-wordpress-theme/full_screen_preview/31422987?_ga=2.63873324.2064031116.1654529768-1907816928.1645096157). (Please check out their amazing Word Press Themes if you haven't already!) 

I have developed a website based on one of their theme with some customizations of my own. This is purely an approach motivated by learning purposes. Almost all the images and graphics used in the website belong to the respective owner and I do not claim any right over them.

## Firebase Live Site Link

The project was deployed at Firebase. One can access the link by clicking here [Firebase Live Site Link](https://testo-burger.web.app/).

## `Technology Used`
    * React.js
    * Material UI
    * React Router (6.2.1)
    * React Redux
    * Redux Toolkit
    * React Stripe JS
    * MongoDB
    * Firebase Authentication
    * Context API
    * Node.js
    * Express.js
    * React Hooks Form
    * React Swiper JS
    * Axios
    * CRUD operations
    * Heroku
    * React Reveal
    * SweetAlert2

### `Project Features`

1. User can add foods from the homepage (`Explore Our Menu` section), `Our Menu` section and `All Items` section under `Shop Tab` available at Navbar. But he/she needs to login first to proceed to Cart. 

2. Applied Private Route (also known as Protected Route/ Authenticated Route) to restrict convenient access. Implemented Google sign in and Github sign in method using Firebase Authentication. User can also register and sign in using their credentials. 

3. The data displayed in the homepage is fetched from MongoDB but for some parts I used static data. Used route parameter to fetch data dynamically from MongoDB and displayed accordingly.

4. Used React Redux for state management of Cart and handling Checkout Data. Followed Ducks pattern while implementing Redux.

5. User can pay with card (integrated payment gateway method specifically Stripe Payment) while ordering.

6. Exhausted CRUD operations on multiple occasions while building the website.

7. In addition, I used MAterial UI to make the website device responsive. Furthermore, we deployed the client site on Firebase which can be accessed through the above mentioned link to explore the website. Server side is deployed using Heroku.

8. Working on to add these features
    * Sign in using Twitter account
    * User can view his/her orders (along with status).
    * Admin/User differentiation.
    * Admin will be able to manage Food Items and Placed Orders.
    * An admin will be capable of adding another user as an admin.
